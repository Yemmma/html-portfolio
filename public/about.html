<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hi, my name is Emma!</h2>

<p>I'm in my mid 20's, which is crazy to say because ever since I turned 18 it's like life has been a blur. Or in better words, my life has been  roller coaster and im watching from the sidelines. Sounds dramatic I know. But all of my experiences have led me here. Learning how to code...something I never thought i'd say or do.</p>

<p>So let's rewind a bit, back to high school! I was an average student, but I was smart. I just lacked effort. And that has been my downfall for a lot of things. Anyway, my goal at that time was to go to college for nursing and then go into anesthesia. Why? The money. And because my parents. Look where that 'dream' got me. I am a college dropout who has attempted many different things but nothing has ever stuck. I try not to let it define me though. I have many hobbies tht I love, building cars, putting together the occasionl puzzle, reading a good suspensful novel, educating myself on new ideas and historic findings, etc.. Oh and I LOVE music and art. But yeah, that's me in a nutshell.</p>
