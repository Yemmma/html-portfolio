<h2>My Top Three Movies...That I Can Think Of</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Because of Winn-Dixie</h3>
<p>This was one of my favorite movies growing up. I would watch it multiple nights in a row. It's honestly been years since ive watched it but I can remember scenes vividly.</p>
<h3>Hidden Figures</h3>
<p>Such a powerful movie with woemn of color breaking the glass ceiling during a time when it was impossible.</p>
<h3>Superman</h3>
<p>And I mean the one with Henry Cavill, stoic but intimidating.</p>
